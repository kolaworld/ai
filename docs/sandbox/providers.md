description: "Pick and configure where a TanStack AI sandbox runs (local process, Docker container, Docker Sandboxes microVM, Daytona, Vercel, Upstash Box, or Blaxel) and what each one can do."
---

A provider owns the isolation primitive: where the harness actually runs. Every
provider implements the same `SandboxProvider` / `SandboxHandle` contract, so the
[workspace](./workspace) you hand the agent and the [policy](./policy) that guards
it are provider-agnostic. Pick a provider for the isolation, auth, and
snapshot/resume behaviour you need; the rest of your sandbox definition stays the
same.

Provider-native snapshots and resume keep or recreate provider state. They can
reduce bootstrap time. [Portable Snapshots](./portable-snapshots) store
completed workspace data in your application persistence for reconstruction.

> The provider is _where_ the agent runs. For _which_ agent runs (Grok Build,
> Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or any ACP agent via `acpCompatible`) see
> [Harnesses](./harnesses).

## Choosing a provider

| Provider | Package | Isolation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local process | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process` | none (host) | The fast, no-Docker dev loop. Trusted/dev use only. |
| Docker | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker` | container | Real isolation; commit-based snapshots, fork, resume-by-id. |
| Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`) | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker` | microVM | Native Docker Sandboxes. Same package as `dockerSandbox()`, different export: `sbxSandbox()`. Needs the `sbx` CLI, a login, and a hypervisor. |
| Daytona | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona` | cloud sandbox | Managed [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/) sandboxes; snapshots after setup, port preview links, resume-by-id. Needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. |
| Vercel | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-vercel` | microVM | Managed [Vercel Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/sandbox) microVMs; exposed-port domains, resume-by-id (persistent). Needs `VERCEL_TOKEN` + team/project. |
| Sprites | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-sprites` | stateful sandbox | Managed [Sprites](https://sprites.dev) (Fly.io) sandboxes; durable filesystem, in-place checkpoints, single proxied public-URL port, resume-by-id. Needs `SPRITES_API_KEY`. |
| Upstash Box | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-upstash-box` | cloud sandbox | Managed [Upstash Box](https://github.com/upstash/box) sandboxes; interactive processes over a WebSocket session (real pid, stdin, signals), native snapshots, preview URLs, resume-by-id. Needs `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY`. |
| Blaxel | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-blaxel` | cloud sandbox | Managed [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai) sandboxes; durable filesystem, per-port preview URLs, native file watch, resume-by-id. Snapshot/fork remain disabled while the source-scoped private-preview semantics are unproven. Needs `BL_API_KEY` + `BL_WORKSPACE`. |

Most providers are their own package. `dockerSandbox()` and `sbxSandbox()` both
come from `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker`. The constructor is the only thing that
differs between them:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'
import { dockerSandbox, sbxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker'
import { daytonaSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona'
import { vercelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-vercel'
import { upstashBoxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-upstash-box'
import { blaxelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-blaxel'

const dev = localProcessSandbox() // runs on your host
const isolated = dockerSandbox({ image: 'node:22' }) // container
const microvm = sbxSandbox() // Docker Sandboxes microVM
const daytona = daytonaSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY }) // managed cloud sandbox
const vercel = vercelSandbox({ runtime: 'node24' }) // managed Vercel microVM
const box = upstashBoxSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY }) // managed Upstash Box
const blaxel = blaxelSandbox() // managed Blaxel sandbox; reads BL_API_KEY + BL_WORKSPACE
```

> Cloud providers (including Daytona, Vercel, Sprites, Upstash Box, and Blaxel)
> run remotely. When you drive them from your laptop, [tools](./tools) bridged
> from `chat()` can't dial your machine's
> `localhost`, you need the bridge tunnel. See the [tools guide](./tools) for the
> ngrok subpath, and the [Cloudflare guide](./cloudflare) for the edge-native
> co-located model.

## Local process

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const dev = localProcessSandbox()
```

- **Isolation:** none. The harness runs directly on your host, inheriting your
  host environment. Use it for trusted or dev work only. There is no boundary
  between the agent and your machine.
- **Auth / env:** inherits the host environment. Set `authMode` on the harness
  (`'host'` or `'api-key'`). The provider does not pick this. See
  [Harness Auth](./auth).
- **Snapshot / resume:** no snapshots and no durable resume-by-id; each run
  re-creates and re-bootstraps under the same identity. The snapshot step is
  skipped silently (see [Capabilities](#capabilities)).

### Host login vs API key (`scrubEnv`)

The provider is where the agent runs, not how it signs in. The default
`authMode` is `'api-key'`. Set `'host'` when the machine already has a CLI
login. A local-process run can be your laptop or a GitHub runner. See
[Harness Auth](./auth).

`localProcessSandbox` inherits the host environment, including any API keys
exported there. If you set `authMode: 'host'`, pass `scrubEnv` so those keys
do not override the CLI login:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const hostLogin = localProcessSandbox({
  scrubEnv: ['XAI_API_KEY', 'GROK_API_KEY'],
})
```

If the same local-process sandbox runs on a CI machine, set
`authMode: 'api-key'`. Then inject the key as a workspace secret. Isolated and
cloud providers have no host CLI login. Use `authMode: 'api-key'` and
workspace secrets there.

### Windows process teardown (`logger`)

Killing a spawned process means killing the whole tree, and on Windows that takes
more than `taskkill /T`. Commands run through a git-bash `sh`, and MSYS's
fork emulation runs the final command of a statement list, such as the
`tail -f` behind a [journal](./journal) follow read, under an intermediate shell
that immediately exits. Windows never reparents, so the surviving process points
at a dead parent and `taskkill /T`, which walks only live parent links, cannot
reach it **while still exiting `0`**. Left alone, every follow read leaks a
process for the life of the machine.

`localProcessSandbox` therefore consults MSYS's own process table, which does
keep the logical parentage before killing, then kills any descendant `/T` missed.
Teardown is total by construction: it never throws, because a throwing kill would
strand a run mid-flight. That means a kill it genuinely cannot complete (a
protected process, access denied) is otherwise invisible, so pass a `logger` to
see it:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const dev = localProcessSandbox({
  logger: {
    warn: (message, meta) => console.warn(message, meta),
  },
})
```

Any object with a `warn(message, meta?)` method works, so the `InternalLogger`
your adapter already receives can be handed straight in. A process that had
already exited on its own is **not** a failure and is never reported.

Nothing here changes on POSIX, where `sh` really is the command's parent and
signalling the wrapper is enough.

## Docker

```ts
import { dockerSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker'

const isolated = dockerSandbox({ image: 'node:22' })
```

- **Isolation:** a real container boundary between the agent and your host.
- **Auth / env:** no host login; provide credentials as workspace secrets, which
  are injected into the container env at create/resume. The agent reaches host
  tools over `host.docker.internal` (see [tools](./tools)).
- **Snapshot / resume:** full commit-based snapshots, `fork`, and resume-by-id.
  Bootstrap snapshots after `setup` completes, so subsequent runs resume from the
  snapshot instead of re-running setup.

## Docker Sandboxes (sbx)

```ts
import { sbxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker'
import { defineSandbox, defineWorkspace, githubRepo } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const isolated = sbxSandbox({
  allowNetwork: ['*.npmjs.org', 'registry.npmjs.org'],
})

const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  id: 'repo-agent',
  provider: isolated,
  workspace: defineWorkspace({
    source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo' }),
    setup: ['pnpm install'],
  }),
})
```

- **Isolation:** a hypervisor microVM. The sandbox has its own kernel and its own Docker daemon. This is not `dockerSandbox()`, which starts a container.
- **Needs:** `sbx` on `PATH`, `sbx login` (or a PAT piped to `sbx login --password-stdin` in CI), and a hypervisor (Hyper-V, Virtualization.framework, or KVM). A Docker socket is not enough.
- **Workspace:** `sbx create --clone` copies a host Git repo into the VM. Pass `workspaceDir` that contains `.git`, or set `workspace.source` to a git URL. If there is no Git repo, create throws. There is no bind-mount fallback.
- **Auth / env:** inject API keys as workspace secrets. v1 does not call `sbx secret`.
- **Snapshot / resume:** no snapshots and no fork. Resume reconnects by name (`sbx ls`). A stopped sandbox starts again on the next `sbx exec`.
- **Network:** this is the first provider with `networkPolicy: true`. See [Policy](./policy).

## Daytona

```ts
import { daytonaSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona'

const daytona = daytonaSandbox({
  apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY,
  snapshot: 'daytona-medium',
  autoStopInterval: 0,
})
```

- **Isolation:** a managed cloud sandbox on a remote VM you do not run yourself.
- **Auth / env:** needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. Put harness credentials in
  [workspace secrets](./provisioning). At create and snapshot restore,
  Daytona stores each value as an organization Secret and mounts a
  placeholder in the sandbox env. The create record, the dashboard env
  view, and session command strings do not contain the real value. Daytona
  substitutes the value on outbound HTTPS requests. Per-command `opts.env`
  uses `executeCommand`'s env argument or a sourced env file. It never
  writes `export KEY=` prefixes into the command string.
- **Snapshot / resume:** point-in-time snapshots after setup (default when
  `lifecycle.snapshot` is `'after-setup'`). Pass `snapshot` on
  `daytonaSandbox()` to pick the Daytona image (for example
  `'daytona-medium'`). Resume starts a `stopped` or `archived` sandbox, then
  returns the handle.
- **Idle stop:** Daytona stops an idle sandbox after 15 minutes by default.
  Set `autoStopInterval` in minutes to change that. Pass `0` to turn auto-stop
  off. Set `ephemeral: true` to delete the sandbox when it stops.
- **Network:** `policy.capabilities.network: 'deny'` blocks all outbound
  network on create.
- **Working directory:** the portable root `/workspace` maps to
  `/home/daytona/workspace` by default. Override with `workdir` on
  `daytonaSandbox()` if you need another path.
- **Stdin:** spawned processes accept host stdin (`writableStdin: true`).
- **Privileges:** the Daytona user is not root. Package installs in `setup`
  must use `sudo -n` (for example `sudo -n apt-get install …`). Do not put
  `sudo *` in a [policy](./policy) deny list for this provider.
- **Bridge:** the sandbox is remote, so a [bridged tool](./tools) call cannot
  reach your laptop's `localhost`. In local dev, tunnel the bridge (see
  [tools](./tools)). A deployed orchestrator is reachable without a tunnel.

Default headless path on Daytona:

```ts
import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { grokBuildText } from '@tanstack/ai-grok-build'
import {
  defineSandbox,
  defineSandboxPolicy,
  defineWorkspace,
  gitSkill,
  githubRepo,
  withSandbox,
} from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
import { daytonaSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona'

const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  id: 'daytona-agent',
  provider: daytonaSandbox({
    apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY,
    snapshot: 'daytona-medium',
  }),
  workspace: defineWorkspace({
    source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/app' }),
    skills: [gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/skills-pack' })],
  }),
  policy: defineSandboxPolicy({
    default: 'allow',
  }),
})

const stream = chat({
  adapter: grokBuildText('grok-build'),
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'List the project files.' }],
  middleware: [withSandbox(sandbox)],
})
```

Headless Grok Build and Codex stay on auto-approve with `default: 'allow'`.
Isolation is the Daytona VM. Use Claude Code when you need command-level deny.

## Vercel

```ts
import { vercelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-vercel'

const vercel = vercelSandbox({ runtime: 'node24' })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed microVM (Vercel Sandbox).
- **Auth / env:** needs `VERCEL_TOKEN` plus a team/project. Harness credentials
  are injected as workspace secrets.
- **Snapshot / resume:** persistent resume-by-id with a durable filesystem, plus
  exposed-port domains for previews.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need the tunnel in local
  dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Sprites

```ts
import { spritesSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-sprites'

const sprites = spritesSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.SPRITES_API_KEY })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Sprites](https://sprites.dev) stateful sandbox
  (Fly.io), a remote VM you do not run yourself.
- **Auth / env:** needs `SPRITES_API_KEY` (token form
  `org/projectNumber/tokenId/secret`); override the control-plane URL with
  `apiUrl` / `SPRITES_API_URL`. Harness credentials are injected as workspace
  secrets.
- **Snapshot / resume:** resume-by-id reconnects to the named Sprite (its
  filesystem is durable across idle suspend/resume). `snapshot()` creates a
  Sprite **checkpoint** (a save point of the writable overlay); restore is
  **in-place** on the same Sprite via the handle's `restoreCheckpoint()` /
  `listCheckpoints()`. A checkpoint does not survive Sprite deletion, so the
  provider intentionally does **not** implement the reconstruct-after-gone
  `restoreSnapshot`, when a Sprite is gone the framework degrades to a fresh
  create instead. Restore restarts the environment and can take minutes;
  `restoreCheckpoint()` polls the workspace until it is listable again before
  resolving. Note that immediately after a restore the overlay can be listable
  while individual file reads briefly return an I/O error as it settles, so retry
  reads if you act on the filesystem the instant restore returns.
- **Ports:** a Sprite proxies a single internal HTTP port (default `8080`,
  configurable via `httpPort`) to its always-on public URL. `ports.connect(8080)`
  switches the URL to `public` auth and returns it; other ports are not exposed.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona and Vercel, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need the tunnel in
  local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Upstash Box

```ts
import { upstashBoxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-upstash-box'

const box = upstashBoxSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Upstash Box](https://github.com/upstash/box) cloud
  sandbox, a remote container you do not run yourself.
- **Auth / env:** needs `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY` (or `apiKey`); override the API
  base with `baseUrl` / `UPSTASH_BOX_BASE_URL`. Pick the image and size with
  `runtime` (default `node`) and `size`.
- **Paths:** the conventional `/workspace` virtual root maps to the box home,
  `/workspace/home`, which is the handle's `workspaceRoot`.
- **Processes:** `spawn()` opens a live `exec.session` over a WebSocket, so a
  background process has a real in-box pid, a writable stdin, separate stdout and
  stderr, and server-side signals. A session owns its process: dropping the
  connection kills the command and sessions cannot be reattached, so `spawn()` is
  scoped to the lifetime of the handle rather than the box. Blocking `exec()`
  stays on the HTTP path and is shell-wrapped for `cwd`/env, which the session
  takes natively.
- **Snapshot / resume:** `snapshot()` calls `box.snapshot()` and
  `restoreSnapshot()` reconstructs a new box from it via `Box.fromSnapshot()`, so
  a snapshot survives deletion of the box that made it. Resume-by-id uses
  `Box.get` (id or name) and probes `getStatus`, so a deleted record resumes as
  `null` rather than a tombstone handle.
- **Ports:** `ports.connect(port)` mints a preview URL via `getPublicURL`. Pass
  `publicUrlAuth` to gate it, `{ bearerToken: true }` returns a token plus an
  `Authorization: Bearer` header and `{ basicAuth: true }` returns Basic
  credentials; without it the preview URL is unauthenticated.
- **Network:** a `policy.capabilities.network` of `'deny'` maps to Box's
  `deny-all` egress mode. The contract's gate is coarse, so Box's domain and CIDR
  allowlists are not reachable through it. This is stricter than providers that
  model deny as an allowlist: `deny-all` blocks every outbound connection, so an
  agent that works under an allowlist-style deny will not reach package
  registries or model provider hosts here. Leave the capability unset if the
  agent needs either.
- **Fork:** `fork()` snapshots the box and creates a new one from that snapshot,
  the same shape as Docker's commit plus create. It costs a full snapshot round
  trip (about 25 seconds), unlike Docker's local commit.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona and Vercel, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need
  the tunnel in local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Blaxel

```ts
import { blaxelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-blaxel'

const blaxel = blaxelSandbox({
  apiKey: process.env.BL_API_KEY,
  workspace: process.env.BL_WORKSPACE,
})
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai) cloud sandbox — a remote VM
  you don't run yourself. Pick the image with `image` (default
  `blaxel/base-image:latest`) and the size with `memory` (default 2048 MB). Set
  `region` (or `BL_REGION`) to choose a region and to silence the SDK's warning
  that it will become required.
- **Auth / env:** needs `BL_API_KEY` and `BL_WORKSPACE`, either as constructor
  options or environment variables. `@blaxel/core` authentication is
  process-global, so use one Blaxel API key/workspace pair per Node.js process
  and do not call `@blaxel/core.initialize()` again afterward. The provider
  rejects a second pair at construction time instead of risking cross-workspace
  requests.
- **Lifetime:** created sandboxes carry a `1h` TTL by default so an abandoned run
  cannot strand a paid sandbox. Override with `ttl`, or pass `ttl: null` to manage
  lifetime yourself.
- **Resume:** resume-by-id reconnects to the named sandbox, and its filesystem
  is durable across idle suspend/resume for the sandbox's lifetime. Blaxel's
  snapshot/fork API is currently a source-scoped private preview, has no
  entitlement probe, and does not document snapshots surviving source deletion.
  The framework requires `snapshots` to reconstruct after the source is gone, so
  this provider conservatively advertises both `snapshots` and `fork` as `false`
  and does not expose `restoreSnapshot`.
- **Ports:** `ports.connect(port)` creates a per-port preview URL. Previews are
  token-gated by default and the returned channel carries both the token and the
  ready-to-send `X-Blaxel-Preview-Token` header. Set `publicPreviews: true` for
  unauthenticated URLs.
- **Files:** `fs.watch()` is native, so file-event and diff hooks work without
  polling.
- **Process output:** stdout and stderr remain live-streamed through bounded
  remote capture pipelines. Each stream has an 8 MiB total limit; exceeding it
  fails and remotely reaps the process instead of accumulating unbounded logs in
  the provider host. Cancellation uses the same process-group supervisor because
  the pinned SDK does not prove named-process kill reaches child processes.
  Custom images must provide Bash plus `cat`, `mkfifo`, `dd`, `base64`, `tr`,
  and `wc` (the default Blaxel base image does). The supervisor invokes Bash
  explicitly so job-control process groups do not depend on the image's
  `/bin/sh` implementation.
- **Resume semantics:** a destroyed sandbox does not disappear immediately —
  Blaxel keeps the record in a teardown state before purging it. `resume()`
  treats deleting, deactivating, failed, and terminated records as gone, while a
  `DEACTIVATED` sandbox remains resumable consistently with the pinned SDK.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona/Vercel, a remote VM — bridged tools need the tunnel in
  local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Capabilities

Providers declare what they support via `capabilities()`. The flags are:

| Capability | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `fs` | Read/write the sandbox filesystem. |
| `exec` | Run commands. |
| `env` | Inject environment variables. |
| `ports` | Expose/forward ports (preview URLs). |
| `backgroundProcesses` | Keep long-running processes alive between calls. |
| `writableStdin` | A spawned process exposes a writable host→process stdin. `true` for local-process, Docker container, Daytona, and Upstash Box. `false` for Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`), Vercel, Sprites, Blaxel, and Cloudflare. When `false`, stdin-fed harnesses write the prompt to a file and redirect it in the shell. |
| `killableProcesses` | A spawned process can be forcibly stopped via `SpawnHandle.kill()` **and** aborted mid-flight via the `signal` passed to `spawn`. |
| `snapshots` | Capture and restore point-in-time snapshots. |
| `networkPolicy` | Enforce network allow/deny rules. |
| `durableFilesystem` | Disk that survives across resumes. |
| `fork` | Branch a sandbox from an existing one. |

Code that uses an **optional** capability checks the flag first and degrades
gracefully. For example, bootstrap only snapshots when `snapshots` is supported,
so `localProcessSandbox` simply skips the step. Calling an unsupported optional
method directly (instead of checking the flag) throws an
`UnsupportedCapabilityError`:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const provider = localProcessSandbox()
const caps = provider.capabilities()

if (caps.snapshots) {
  // safe to take a snapshot
} else {
  // degrade gracefully, local-process has no snapshots
}
```

Use the flags to write provider-agnostic code: branch on the capability rather
than the concrete provider, and your sandbox definition keeps working when you
swap one provider for another.

### `killableProcesses` across the bundled providers

This flag is **measured, not asserted**. A wrong `true` hands the journal reader
an unstoppable `tail -f` and leaks a process per run, so a provider only declares
it once killing has been observed to work against a real sandbox. Two of these
declarations were once `true` on reasoning alone and both turned out to be false
when probed (Docker's stream destroy left the container-side process in `ps`;
local-process's `sh -c` did not `exec`, so killing the shell left the command
alive). Anything that cannot be measured yet stays `false`, because `poll` is
merely slower while a wrong `follow` is a leak.

| Provider | `killableProcesses` | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local process | `true` | **Measured.** Kills the process GROUP, not the wrapper: `detached` spawn plus `process.kill(-pid, signal)` on POSIX (killing only the `sh` left the command running, dash does not reliably `exec`); on Windows `taskkill /T` plus a verified sweep, see [Windows teardown](#windows-process-teardown-logger). |
| Docker | `true` | **Measured.** Signals the process INSIDE the container by the pid the wrapper recorded for itself, process group first and escalating to `KILL`. Destroying the hijacked exec stream is *not* sufficient: it only detaches the client. |
| Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`) | `false` | Unmeasured. Live tests named-skip until `sbx login`. The handle records a pid in the VM, but `killableProcesses` stays `false` until that kill is observed. |
| Daytona | `false` | `kill()` only aborts the client-side poll loop and does not await any termination; the `deleteSession` that might terminate the command runs later from the pump's teardown, is failure-swallowed, and is documented as cleanup for a *completed* session. Unmeasured, needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. |
| Vercel | `false` | The abort signal reaches only the HTTP request that STARTS a detached command, so the old `kill()` was a no-op. It now issues the SDK's server-side `Command.kill`, but whether that reaches a forked child (the follow command is a multi-statement shell, so `tail -f` is always a child) is unmeasured, needs Vercel credentials. |
| Sprites | `true` (unverified) | Not a client-side detach: `kill()` issues a real server-side `POST /exec/<sessionId>/kill` before closing the socket. What that endpoint signals (process group or pid) is undocumented and unmeasured; needs `SPRITES_API_KEY`. |
| Upstash Box | `true` | **Measured.** `kill()` sends an allowlisted signal (`TERM`/`KILL`/`INT`/`HUP`) that the box agent delivers to the process TREE server-side, so a forked child is signalled too. Verified against production: a spawned `sleep 5 && touch <marker>` was killed and the marker never appeared. Needs `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY`. |
| Blaxel | `false` | The SDK issues a server-side process kill, but whether it terminates the shell's child process group is unmeasured. The shared live conformance suite is credential-gated on `BL_API_KEY` and `BL_WORKSPACE`. |
| Cloudflare | `false` | `kill()` is a no-op, and the caller's `AbortSignal` reaches neither `exec` nor `spawn`, because Workers RPC cannot serialize one. |

Each of the remote providers registers the shared journal conformance suite, so
the claim is falsifiable rather than asserted: with credentials present the suite
runs against a real sandbox, and without them it reports a **named skip** carrying
the reason instead of a silent pass. Cloudflare's gate is the runtime rather than
credentials, its provider can only create a sandbox through a `Sandbox` Durable
Object binding, which no Node test process has, so its registration is a named
skip saying exactly that, until a Workers-runtime harness can measure it.

This flag is required on every provider, including a bring-your-own one. A
provider that omitted it would be treated as killable, which is the dangerous
default: a follower process started there could never be reclaimed, and it would
keep running inside the sandbox for as long as the sandbox lives.

It is the flag the [run journal](./journal) reads to decide how to tail a run's
output: a killable provider gets a streaming `tail -f`, and a provider like
Cloudflare gets a loop of bounded reads, each of which terminates on its own.

The flag also bounds what *cancel* can mean. On a `false` provider there is no
signal path to the agent process, so the only cancel that actually stops the
agent means destroying the sandbox, which is what the cancel path does. See
[what cancel means on a provider that cannot kill](./takeover#what-cancel-means-on-a-provider-that-cannot-kill).
